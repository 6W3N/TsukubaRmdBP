This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a MT or DT in Tsukuba Univ. BP.
[RMarkdown Cook Book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) will answer the almost question you have.

\chapter{Chapter 1 Title}
\label{Chap1}

This section will be just provide the reference examples.
You can add references by adding `@hogehoge` in RMarkdown and .bib file. A simple way to make a .bib file is to use google scholar(see [here](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) or [here](http://ajdkbsuvi.blogspot.com/2011/02/google-scholarbibtex.html)). Also [`citr`](https://github.com/crsh/citr) package help you.

We can use four inline citation styles as belows:

- `[@singlecite]`: single citation
- `[@cite1; @cite2]`: multiple citations
- `[-@singlecite]`: just display the year
- `[see @cite1 p 12; also this ref @cite2]`: valid syntax

We provide the example below. 
Multicellular organisms are keeping time not by one clock but by averaging many independent circadian oscillators [@winfree1975unclocklike].
Our state are consistent with @darwin2004origin and @smith1993theory.

\chapter{Chapter 2 Title}
\label{Chap2}

This section will provide the `\chapter` and `\section` functions in the RMarkdown file. 
The both `\chapter` and `\section` functions provide the numbering sections but this sample RMarkdown files mainly use `\chapter` for following structure of contents.

- Title
- Abstract
- List of Tables
- List of Figures
- General Introduction
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2
- General Discussion
- References

If you want to add section (i.e., Introduction in Chapter 2), then add `\section` function after `\chapter{Chapter 2}` like belows.

\section{Introduction in Chapter 2}
